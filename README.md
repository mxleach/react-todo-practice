# React Todo Practice App
## Thanks for checking out my app!

- This project  _was_ and _is_ intended to be a work in progress; it's pulled/referenced from an extra-credit assignment during the MIT xPro Full-Stack Bootcamp. 

- I plan on integrating a 'Trello-like' UI with the current functionality and adding some additional features. I like the Trello UI, however, this app will make it easier to delete and/or mark tasks as 'completed'. 

- While I wish I shared my personal submission to GitHub as a student, this current version demonstrates an optimized, cleaned up and formatted version with room for UI improvements. (I've cleared the UI from my og submission)
